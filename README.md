# Mistral + Godot LLMSubsystem 
## Language models for godot resource generation at runtime.

![example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/beafdd64-b96b-4de5-b3d2-5ec16519e3a5)

An opinionated system for using fewshot learning and aggressive validation to plug language model outputs into godot games as stateful procedurally generated objects instead of just text.

The LLMSubsystem directory should be portable to other projects - this particular repo uses a multiplayer server provisioned by Jam Launch to keep the API key hidden from end users.

See a deployed version of this repo at https://mistralexample.jamlaunch.net/

Or a slightly more ambitious in development example at https://stardate.jamlaunch.net/.
