# Mistral + Godot
## Language models for godot resource generation at runtime.

 This repo shows one approach to using fewshot learning and post generation validation of language model outputs to pipe 

The LLMSubsystem directory should be portable to other projects - this particular repo uses a multiplayer server provisioned by Jam Launch to keep the API key hidden from end users.

See a deployed version of this repo at https://mistralexample.jamlaunch.net/


Or a slightly more ambitious in development example at https://stardate.jamlaunch.net/.
